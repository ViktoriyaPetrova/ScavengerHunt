# ScavengerHunt

This program was created for CS 163 at Portland State University. It's a simulation of a Halloween themed scavenger hunt that
allows the user to create a list of items to scavenge around their neighborhood. 

There is a main menu which lets the tester chose from 3 different options: testing the game, testing the queue data structure, 
and testing the hash table data structure. When testing the game, different parts of the hash table data structure and the queue 
data structure are called upon based on what is needed at that moment. When testing the queue the tester is given a menu of options 
to chose from so that different aspects of the queue can be fully tested. The same goes for the hash table option. A menu of choices 
is provided so that all aspects can be fully tested.
